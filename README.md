#  Medical Data Visualizer

This project analyzes and visualizes medical examination data to explore the relationship between health indicators and cardiovascular disease.

##  Key Features

* **Overweight Detection**: Adds a column to flag individuals with a BMI over 25.
* **Data Normalization**: Reclassifies cholesterol and glucose levels so that healthy = 0 and unhealthy = 1.
* **Categorical Plot**: Visualizes lifestyle and health factors (like smoking, alcohol, activity, etc.) grouped by cardiovascular disease status.
* **Heat Map**: Shows correlations between medical variables after cleaning extreme and inconsistent values.

##  Tools Used

* **Pandas** for data processing
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for visualization
* **NumPy** for numeric operations

##  Dataset

The dataset includes age, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and lifestyle indicators of patients, along with a cardiovascular disease label.

##  Purpose

Built as a data science practice project to apply skills in:

* Data cleaning
* Feature engineering
* Visualization
* Exploratory data analysis
